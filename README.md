# Urban Accessibility Analysis Using H3 Grid üåç üíª  üìÅ 
## Project Overview

This project analyzes urban accessibility in New York City by examining the availability of essential amenities such as schools, subway entrances, bike paths, and parks using the H3 hexagonal grid system.
## Skills Learned

- **Geospatial Data Handling**: Proficient in using GeoPandas for managing and analyzing geospatial data.
- **Data Normalization**: Implemented Min-Max normalization techniques to standardize metrics for comparison.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Conducted spatial analyses using buffer zones and H3 grids to assess accessibility.
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive maps using Leafmap to visualize accessibility scores.

## Key Concepts  üìí 

- **H3 Grid System**: Utilized the H3 hexagonal grid for efficient spatial analysis and aggregation of neighborhood data.
- **Buffer Analysis**: Analyzed amenities within specified distances to understand access levels.
- **Aggregation of Metrics**: Combined data from neighboring hexagons to provide comprehensive accessibility scores.

## Libraries Used :globe_with_meridians:

- **GeoPandas**: For geospatial data manipulation and analysis.
- **Leafmap**: For creating interactive maps to visualize geospatial data.
- **H3-Py**: For working with the H3 grid system to perform spatial analyses.
- **Matplotlib**: For static plotting and visualization of data insights.
- **Scikit-learn (MinMaxScaler)**: For normalizing data to ensure comparability across metrics.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Function Development**: Developed functions for neighborhood analysis and access calculations.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated metrics from neighboring cells to enhance analysis quality.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Designed visual representations of data to communicate findings effectively.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to apply geospatial analysis techniques, normalize data, and visualize results effectively. It demonstrates my skills in urban planning and resource allocation through data-driven insights.
